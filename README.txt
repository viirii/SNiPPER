- modify parameter.txt to adjust the settings
- for more information on each setting, please read the report
- while modifying parameter, do not add extra lines, etc. (just change the values)
- directory with .go file should contain parameter.txt, all chromosome.fasta file, and target.txt
- chromosome files must have “chr” in filename somewhere. 
- chromosome file must follow standard fasta format/convention
- target.txt must have only the sequence of the target gene (no indices, other information) and must be named target.txt as filename
- to run your chromosome, make sure parameter & chromosome are in same directory as your .go folder, and run it. No need to input any filename as long as everything has correct filename format
